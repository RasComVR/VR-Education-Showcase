The mobile VR education showcase is a project which shows how smartphones using a Google cardboard VR viewer can be used in education. Google cardboard viewers use a smart phone to let the user see virtual environments with 3 degrees of freedom. These are rotational degrees of freedom which allow the user to look left / right, up / down, and tilt. A simple click based interface gives the user the ability to interact with the VR world. The Oculus Go, the Samsung Gear, the Google Daydream, and Google Cardboard are all examples of headsets with 3 degrees of freedom (3dof). More modern headsets like the Oculus Rift, Oculus Quest, HTC Vive, and Valve Index are headsets that have the 3 rotational degrees of freedom, but also have 3 translational degrees of freedom. Translational degrees of freedom allow the user to move forward / backward, left / right, and up / down. The combination gives these headsets a total of 6 degrees of freedom (6dof) and this makes the experience much more natural. However, smart phones are not able to track translational motion on the scale needed for a VR viewer, and this project focuses on the 3dof experience.

This project is a virtual environment which the user can move around in, and interact with showcases that give examples of how VR can be used in education. The showcases describe the following:

1. Interactive 3D animations

2. Google Expeditions

3. A Virtual Art Gallery

4. 360 videos

5. Science Class Use Cases

 ## 3D Interactive Animations

Seeing 3D animations can be more intuitive to a human since we see and interact with the world in 3D. For this example, when the user clicks on the showcase arrow, a model of the Earth and the Moon will appear. The Moon orbits the Earth, and the Earth rotates. The animation can be changed when clicked again so that the Earth fades away and the Moon will be centered while rotating. Letting the user control how the animations change give them more agency to give a more interactive experience.

Apps can be made which allows for students to work through interactive animations at their own pace, and see larger objects in front of them which adds to the immersion.

## Google Expeditions

Google launched an app which has guided tours that teachers can use in the classroom. The teacher has the app installed on a tablet or phone, and the students can all use their smartphones in cardboard viewers to experience the app. This showcase introduces how this can be used in the classroom to enable virtual fieldtrips.

## Android Build

To access a build of the Mobile VR Education Showcase, use this link:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BgX6zO4yCjlYIO-qP0v6jYNhHPVTuP7O/view?usp=sharing

This is a build for Android smart phones only. To view the project, follow these steps.

* Download the apk file from the google drive link.

* Copy the apk file to your Android phone.

* Install the project by launching the apk file. You will most likely be asked if you want to install apps that are not from the Google play store. Click yes.

* Once the app has installed, launch it.

* You will probably be prompted to place your phone in a cardboard VR viewer. After doing this you should be able to interact with the project and explore it!
