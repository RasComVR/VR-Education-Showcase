# A Night at the Museum - VR Education Showcase #
Nathan Rasmussen

The VR education showcase has 5 showcases that inform the viewer about the benefits of using VR in the classroom. The user can travel around via the waypoints and activate each showcase when desired. There are three platforms that contain the showcases and the user can teleport to each platform by clicking on a sign at the end of each platform.

For this project I used the googleVR sdk 1.20.0. Overall I spend a really long time on this, but I learned a ton about how to optimize my code and despite the fact that it is still a bit messy, I figured out a lot of ways to organize the gameobjects. One big lesson was that making very general scripts that can be attached to several different gameobjects and the variables are just changed in the inspector was helpful for having to keep track of a ton of things. I know that was something we learned early but it is always good to keep finding ways to make things run smoother and have a better organization.

This project is important to me because I teach physics and chemistry so the use of VR in a STEM classroom is one that I am very interested in!
